# Twitter Sentiment Analysis

## Introduction
This project aims to analyze and classify the sentiment of tweets using natural language processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning algorithms. The sentiment analysis system is developed in Python and leverages various libraries to preprocess the data, extract features, and build a sentiment classification model.

## Features
- **Data Preprocessing:** Cleans the dataset by removing URLs, hashtags, mentions, stop words, and other unnecessary elements.
- **Text Normalization:** Applies lemmatization and tokenization to standardize the text data.
- **Feature Extraction:** Utilizes TF-IDF Vectorizer to convert text data into numerical vectors for model training.
- **Model Training:** Implements Logistic Regression for sentiment classification.
- **Performance Evaluation:** Evaluates the model using accuracy score and confusion matrix.
